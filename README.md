Image classification with Keras and TensorFlow

The aim of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network model to classify images of Dogs and Cats and especially to demostrate how to : 
* Handle big image datasets using Data Generators to feed CNN on the go trough small batches of images during training without having to load the entire heavy dataset at once in memory 
* Tackle overfitting using techniques like Data Augmentation and Regularization dropouts
